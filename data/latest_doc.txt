2. Pranayama: Agni Sara (2 min)
➢ Stand with feet wide, exhale fully, then rapidly pull belly in/out (like a "pump") for
10 breaths. Rest, repeat.
➢ Massages digestive organs, stimulates metabolism, reduces bloating.
Evening Routine (6–8 min) :
1. Pranayama: Left Nostril Breathing (3 min)
➢ Close right nostril, inhale/exhale only through left for 10 rounds.
➢ Cools the body, reduces acidity, calms nervous system (linked to digestion).
2. Asana: Pawanmuktasana (2 min)
➢ Lie on back, hug right knee to chest, hold. Switch sides. Then hug both knees.
➢ Releases trapped gas, relieves bloating, stretches lower back.
3. Legs-Up-the-Wall (Viparita Karani) (2 min)
➢ Lie on back, extend legs up a wall (or on a chair). Breathe deeply.
➢ Reduces stress hormones (cortisol worsens digestion), improves circulation.
